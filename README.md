Introduction

The NFC Card Reader Solution is a software project that allows interaction with NFC (Near Field Communication) cards using a compatible card reader. The solution consists of a Product Controller and associated services, which provide APIs for managing products, and an NFCReader class, responsible for handling card-related operations.

Product Controller and Services

The Product Controller is the core of the solution, offering various HTTP endpoints for managing products. Here are the main functions provided by the controller:
•	GET /api/products: Retrieves a list of products.
•	GET /api/products/{id}: Retrieves a specific product by its unique identifier.
•	POST /api/products: Creates a new product.
•	PUT /api/products/{id}: Updates an existing product.
•	DELETE /api/products/{id}: Deletes a product.
These endpoints enable users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

NFCReader Class

The NFCReader class is a critical component of the NFC Card Reader Solution. It allows communication with NFC cards through a compatible card reader. Here's how it works:
Card Insertion and Removal Handling:
The NFCReader class has two events:
•	CardInserted: Triggered when a card is inserted into the card reader.
•	CardRemoved: Triggered when a card is removed from the card reader.
These events are essential for detecting card-related actions and can be subscribed to in your application. For instance, you can use them to trigger specific actions when a card is inserted or removed, like reading card data or updating user authentication status.
